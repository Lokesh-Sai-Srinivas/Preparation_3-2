Definition**\nVirtualization is a technology that allows you to create multiple simulated environments or dedicated resources from a single, physical hardware system. It uses software (Hypervisor) to abstract the hardware for multiple virtual machines (VMs).\n\n**2. Key Concepts**\n*   **Hypervisor:** The software layer that manages VMs (e.g., VMware, KVM).\n*   **Host Machine:** The physical hardware providing the resources.\n*   **Guest Machine (VM):** The virtualized environment running an OS.\n\n**3. Conclusion**\nVirtualization is the core enabling technology of cloud computing, allowing multi-tenancy and efficient resource usage.",

Introduction**\nSOA is a style of software design where services are provided to the other components by application components, through a communication protocol over a network.\n\n**2. Principles of SOA**\n*   **Loose Coupling:** Services are independent and do not rely on each other's internal execution.\n*   **Reusability:** Services are designed to be used in multiple applications.\n*   **Interoperability:** Different systems can communicate regardless of platform.\n\n**3. Conclusion**\nSOA allows for flexible and scalable system design by breaking down large applications into manageable, autonomous services.",

It is essential in both local and distributed systems.\n\n**2. Major IPC Mechanisms**\n*   **Shared Memory:** Fast, as processes share a portion of memory.\n*   **Message Passing:** Processes exchange messages (good for distributed systems).\n*   **Pipes/Sockets:** Streams of data between processes.\n\n**3.

Introduction**\nRPC is a protocol that one program can use to request a service from a program located in another computer on a network without having to understand the network's details.\n\n**2. Working Mechanism**\n*   **Stub:** A small program that mimics the remote function.\n*   **Marshalling:** Packaging the parameters into a standard format for transmission.\n*   **Execution:** Remote server executes the call and sends the result back.\n\n**3.

(ii) SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)**\n*   **Role:** A lightweight protocol intended for exchanging structured information in a decentralized, distributed environment.\n*   **Function:** Defines the *rules* for the messages sent between WSDL endpoints.\n\n**4.

Introduction**\nIn cloud computing, virtualization acts as the \"engineroom\" that separates the physical hardware from the computing resources used by consumers.\n\n**2.
