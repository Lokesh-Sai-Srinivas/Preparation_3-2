Definition**\nAgile Methodology is an iterative and incremental approach to software development that emphasizes flexibility, customer collaboration, and rapid delivery of working software in small cycles called **sprints**.\n\n**2. Key Characteristics**\n*   **Iterative:** Work is divided into small chunks.\n*   **Collaborative:** Continuous interaction with stakeholders.\n*   **Adaptive:** Welcomes changes even late in development.\n\n**3.
