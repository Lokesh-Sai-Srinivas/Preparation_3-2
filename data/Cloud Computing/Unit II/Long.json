A large problem is broken down into smaller parts, which are then solved concurrently by different processors.\n\n**2. Key Elements of Parallel Computing**\n*   **Hardware:** Multi-core CPUs, GPUs, and distributed clusters.\n*   **Software:** Parallel algorithms and concurrent programming models (like OpenMP or MPI).\n*   **Memory Architecture:** Shared memory (all CPUs talk to one RAM) or Distributed memory (each CPU has its own RAM).\n*   **Communication:** Interconnects that allow processors to exchange data.\n\n**3. Flynn's Taxonomy (Architectural Classification)**\n\n*   **I. SISD (Single Instruction, Single Data):**\n    *   The classic Von Neumann architecture. One processor executes one instruction on one data point at a time.\n    *   **Example:** Traditional single-core desktop computers.\n\n*   **II. SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data):**\n    *   A single instruction is broadcast to multiple processors, each operating on different data simultaneously.\n    *   **Example:** Vector processors, GPUs (ideal for graphics and data-heavy math).\n\n*   **III. MISD (Multiple Instruction, Single Data):**\n    *   Multiple processors execute different instructions on the same data stream. \n    *   **Example:** Extremely rare. Used for high-reliability systems like redundant flight control sensors.\n\n*   **IV. MIMD (Multiple Instruction, Multiple Data):**\n    *   Multiple autonomous processors execute different instructions on different data. \n    *   **Example:** Modern multi-core servers, cloud computing clusters. This is the most efficient for general-purpose parallel tasks.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nFlynn's taxonomy provides a clear way to understand how hardware is optimized for different types of parallel tasks, with MIMD being the foundation of modern cloud clusters.",

        "a": "### **Virtualization: Need & Significance**\n\n**1. Introduction**\nVirtualization is the creation of a virtual (rather than physical) version of something, such as an operating system, server, or storage device. It is the core technology that enables cloud computing.\n\n**2. The Need for Virtualization**\n*   **Server Underutilization:** Before virtualization, physical servers typically ran at only 10% - 15% of their capacity. Virtualization allows multiple VMs to share one physical server, pushing utilization up to 80%.\n*   **High Hardware Costs:** Buying a separate machine for every application is expensive. Virtualization saves billions in hardware and electricity costs.\n*   **Rigidity:** Physical hardware is hard to move or upgrade. Virtual machines are just files on a disk that can be copied or moved easily.\n\n**3. Significance in Cloud Computing**\n*   **A. Multi-tenancy:** Allows cloud providers to safely host thousands of different customers on the same shared physical hardware.\n*   **B. Rapid Provisioning:** A new server (VM) can be created from a template in seconds, fulfilling the \"On-demand\" characteristic of cloud computing.\n*   **C. Fault Tolerance:** If a physical server fails, the virtual machines can be instantly rebooted on a different physical server, ensuring high availability.\n*   **D. Resource Isolation:** A crash or security breach in one VM does not affect other VMs running on the same hardware.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nVirtualization converts rigid, expensive hardware into a flexible, software-defined resource pool, making the cloud ecosystem possible.",

The growth of cloud computing is directly tied to the transition from localized networks to high-speed, ubiquitous global internet access.\n\n**2. Evolution of Connectivity**\n*   **Low Speed Era:** In the early days, internet was slow and unreliable, limiting the cloud to simple text/storage.\n*   **High Speed Era (4G/5G/Fiber):** Today, high-speed fiber and 5G connections allow high-definition video streaming, cloud gaming, and real-time AI processing over the web.\n\n**3. Key Roles of Ubiquitous Internet**\n*   **A. Global Accessibility:** Users can access their files (Google Photos, iCloud) from any device (Mobile, PC) anywhere in the world.\n*   **B. Device Independence:** Since the computing happens in the cloud, users can use \"Thin Clients\" (cheap, low-power devices) to access powerful applications.\n*   **C. Real-time Collaboration:** Ubiquitous internet allows teams in different continents to edit the same document (Google Docs) simultaneously with millisecond latency.\n*   **D. Internet of Things (IoT):** Millions of sensors globally can stream data constantly to the cloud for real-time analysis.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nThe internet is the \"Supply Chain\" of cloud computing.

The Role of Remote Procedure Call (RPC)**\n*   **Defining RPC:** It is a protocol that allows a program to call a function on a different machine as if it were a local function call. \n*   **Internal Communication:** In a cloud system like Amazon, the \"User Profile Service\" needs to talk to the \"Billing Service.\" RPC is the glue that allows these different servers to talk seamlessly.\n*   **Abstraction:** It hides the complex networking logic (TCP/IP, Sockets, Serialization) from the developer, and lets them focus on code.\n\n**4. Key Components of RPC**\n*   **Stub:** A small piece of code on the client that mimics the remote function.\n*   **Marshalling:** Converting data types (like an object) into a format that can be sent over the wire.\n\n**5.

Platform Independence:** Allows a Windows mobile app to talk to a Linux server in the cloud effortlessly.\n*   **C.

Dynamic Resource Allotment:** If an app suddenly needs more RAM, the Hypervisor can pull memory from an idle VM and give it to the active one without stopping the server.\n*   **B. Workload Balancing (Live Migration):** If one physical server is getting too hot or busy, virtualization allows us to \"move\" a running VM to a different physical server with zero downtime.\n*   **C. Optimization (Consolidation):** At night, when demand is low, a cloud provider can pack all active VMs onto a few servers and turn off the rest to save power.\n*   **D.
