Definition**\nVirtualization is the process of creating a software-based (virtual) representation of something, such as virtual applications, servers, storage, and networks. It uses software called a **Hypervisor** to abstract hardware resources.\n\n**2. Key Component**\n*   **Hypervisor (VMM):** Software that manages the distribution of physical resources to multiple virtual machines (VMs).\n\n**3. Conclusion**\nIt is the foundational technology of cloud computing, enabling efficient resource sharing and multi-tenancy.",

Definition**\nSOA is an architectural style in software design where components provide services to other components via a communications protocol over a network.\n\n**2. Key Principles**\n*   **Loose Coupling:** Services are independent and don't rely on the internal state of others.\n*   **Reusability:** Services can be combined in different ways to build new apps.\n\n**3. Conclusion**\nSOA is the predecessor to modern Microservices and is essential for cloud modularity.",

Definition**\nIPC is a mechanism provided by the operating system that allows processes to communicate and synchronize their actions, either on a single machine or across a network.\n\n**2. Main Methods**\n*   **Shared Memory:** Fast, processes read/write to same memory block.\n*   **Message Passing:** Processes exchange data packets (ideal for distributed systems).\n\n**3.

Role in Cloud**\n*   **Abstraction:** It hides network complexity.\n*   **Communication:** Enables different servers in a cloud cluster to talk to each other.\n\n**3.

(ii) SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)**\n*   **Role:** A protocol for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services (The \"How\").\n    *   *Example:* The envelope that carries the service data.\n\n**3.

Very rare (used in flight sensors).\n*   **MIMD (Multiple Instruction, Multiple Data):** Multiple processors execute different instructions on **different** data independently.
